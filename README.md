3NF 10 tables with indexes and sample queries

The project has 3 parts.

In the first part database model is created with the relations according to the given schema. Most important challenges in this part was normalizing the database and defining table relations appropriately.

After the model is created queries are added in such a way that there will be no empty results when the sample queries are executed.

Lastly, some sample queries are implemented filtering, updating or deleting entries with respect to given criterias within the same table or a different table in the database.
